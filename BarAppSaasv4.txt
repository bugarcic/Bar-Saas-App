Bar Application Saas Co
Same for ALL 4 Departments
Forms (same statewide):
– Application for Admission Questionnaire 
– Good Moral Character Affirmations (2) 
– Law-Related Employment
– Law School Certificate(s) 
– 50-Hour Pro Bono Affidavit (exam admission only)
– Skills Competency & Professional Values Affidavit
Attorney Registration (OCA): All applicants must complete online attorney registration and pay the biennial fee (currently $375) before admission. Only the Second Department requires the OCA registration receipt to be filed with the admission packet.
Three-year filing deadline (exam admission): A complete application must be filed within 3 years under Court rules (for UBE takers, 3 years from the second day of the UBE, subject to any extension the Appellate Division may grant for good cause).
 First Department (AD1 – Manhattan / Bronx)
* When you can file
   * You cannot file AD1 application papers until after you’ve passed and been certified to AD1 by BOLE.
* How you file
   * All completed application materials must be uploaded to AD1’s online portal as PDFs.
* Law School Certificate handling
   * Your law school must send the Law School Certificate as a PDF directly by email to ad1cfc@nycourts.gov (not by paper mail). 
* Orientation to the Profession (AD1-specific flavor)
   * AD1 requires you to complete a two-hour online Orientation to the Profession Program within one year before admission. You must watch the video, collect embedded codes, and submit an Orientation Certificate of Completion as part of your application package (or supplement later if you do the program after you file).
Second Department (AD2 – Brooklyn / Queens / Staten Island / Long Island)
* Orientation to the Profession
   * AD2 also requires an Orientation to the Profession Program (three-hour online). You must attach the original, signed Orientation Certificate of Completion as the last exhibit in your application package. 
* OCA registration receipt: AD2 is the only department that requires you to attach proof you’ve registered with OCA and paid the fee:
   * After you receive your Notice of Certification, you must register online with OCA and attach a copy of the OCA registration receipt to your application. 
* How you file
   * AD2 requires the entire completed application package to be submitted by email in PDF form to AD2CCF@nycourts.gov. 
   * You must include a statement in the email that the digitized documents are a complete and accurate representation of the originals, and you must keep all originals in case they ask for them. 
* When to file (practical preference)
   * Legally, like AD3/AD4, you may file after taking the bar. But AD2’s supplemental instructions say that “in the normal course” you should only file after you have your Notice of Certification (or motion-letter for admission on motion). 
* Moral-character & employment rules (stricter AD2 tweaks)
   * AD2 bans moral-character affirmations from:
      * people who signed your employment affirmations, and
      * people who know you solely through an employment relationship. 
   * The “dated within 60 days of filing” rule for character/employment proofs is stated and can be waived in the Committee’s discretion (this timing rule is much more explicit in AD2 than elsewhere).
* Extra supporting documents explicitly required with the application
   * AD2 tells you to attach (not just “be prepared to show”) the following when applicable:
      * Marriage certificate or court order for any name change.
      * Certificate of disposition or similar original for any criminal or alcohol-related offense (if “yes” to Q26).
      * Copies of judgments or other dispositions in civil cases.
      * Supporting documentation if “yes” to Q33 (discipline / licenses, etc.).
* Pro Bono / Skills affidavits can be unsworn affirmations
   * AD2 explicitly says the Pro Bono and Skills forms may be completed as affirmations under penalty of perjury (instead of notarized affidavits). 
Third Department (AD3 – Albany / upstate default for non-NY residents)
1. Who gets sent to AD3 by default
   * If you neither live nor work in New York, BOLE certifies you by default to the Third Department.
2. How you file
   * Under the current AD3 “How to Apply” instructions, all applications and supporting documents MUST be submitted via email in digital (PDF) format.
   * Like AD2, you must include a statement that the digitized documents are a complete and accurate representation of the originals, and the court can later require production of the originals.
3. Timing & process flavor
   * AD3 reiterates the general rule that you can file after the exam; then, once you’re certified and have submitted a complete application, you get put in line for the next available ceremony on a first-come, first-served basis.
   * You pay the OCA registration fee after your application is approved but before the ceremony; they don’t require you to attach the receipt to the application like AD2 does.
4. Orientation
   * There is no separate AD3 Orientation to the Profession program requirement in their rules; the orientation requirement is expressly only for the First and Second Departments.
Fourth Department (AD4 – Western / Central NY) 
1. Encouraged early filing
   * Like AD2/AD3, AD4 allows filing after taking the exam, and they explicitly encourage you to submit your application before results are released.
2. Hard ceremony deadlines tied to postmark dates
   * AD4 is unique in having strict, published deadlines for each admission ceremony:
      * Example: for the January 14, 2026 ceremony, completed applications and all required affidavits/certificates must be postmarked on or before September 30, 2025; miss that and you’re bumped to the June ceremony.
   * So AD4’s practical workflow is “complete application by a certain date or you wait ~6 months,” unlike AD1–AD3, which run on a rolling/queue basis.
3. How you file
   * AD4’s current site describes a traditional mail-based system: you send the application questionnaire and all supporting forms/affidavits to the Rochester address; the page emphasizes postmarked deadlines and does not substitute an email-PDF requirement like AD2/AD3.
4. Orientation
   * AD4 does not have a department-specific Orientation to the Profession requirement in its rules; the orientation requirement is limited to the First and Second Departments.

Statewide (all Depts): Same C-Bar form; 2 affirmants who have known you 2+ years, are reputable, and are not relatives, employers, law-school faculty/admin, or other applicants.
Second Department (D2 only): Character affirmants cannot also sign your employment affirmations, cannot know you only as an employer/supervisor, and their affirmations are expected to be dated within 60 days before filing (waivable).
First, Third, Fourth (D1/D3/D4): Follow only the statewide C-Bar rules above; no extra timing/identity restrictions like D2’s 60-day rule.

Second Department (D2 only): Same H-form, but AD2’s supplemental instructions allow it to be completed as an affirmation under penalty of perjury (no notary) instead of a notarized affidavit; they also restate the usual exemptions (commenced studies on/before Aug. 1, 2016, certain Spring 2020 grads).

* Signature, title, and contact info of law school official; date; school seal.
If the school supplies a non-English certificate, the app must trigger the translation + translator-certification requirements (Section 14).
The app should generate one Law School Certificate per law school and pre-fill the applicant section.


Certificates of Good Standing and Grievance / Disciplinary Letters (Other Jurisdictions)
Required When: Only for applicants already admitted to practice elsewhere.
Information to collect and track
For each state, D.C., territory, or foreign jurisdiction of admission:
* Court/licensing authority name.
* Date of admission.
* Current status (active, inactive, retired, suspended, resigned, etc.).
* Original certificate of good standing (recently dated, per the instructions).
* Original disciplinary/grievance letter from the relevant authority indicating whether there is any past or pending discipline.
For each U.S. federal court where applicant is admitted:
* Name of court (e.g., S.D.N.Y., 2d Cir.).
* Date of admission.
* Original certificate of good standing from each such court.
The app should:
* Prompt the user to list all courts of admission (state/foreign and U.S. federal).
* Prompt upload of each certificate/letter and record dates requested/received.
* Trigger additional explanatory fields if any document notes past or pending discipline.
* Trigger translation/foreign-notary logic where any certificate/letter is not in English or sworn abroad.


“Other Papers” and Supporting Documents 
For every “Yes” answer in the Questionnaire that asks for explanation, the app should:
* Require a narrative explanation field, and
* Provide an upload slot for supporting documents.
* Provide example language
Typical categories:
* Identity / status: birth certificate, name-change orders, immigration documents.
* Criminal matters: complaints, police reports, plea agreements, sentencing orders, proof of completion. [this is common, speeding and drinking tickets – people don’t know where to go or what to do so we should provide extra guidance here]
* Civil matters: complaints, judgments, settlement agreements, orders.
* Financial matters: bankruptcy petitions and discharge orders, tax notices, lien release, payment agreements, proof of payments.
* Academic/Professional discipline: letters or orders describing violations and sanctions. [here too, don’t give legal advice though]
* Child support and family law: orders, payment records, arrears statements.
If a required record truly cannot be obtained, the app should generate an Affidavit of Inability to Comply with:
* Exact description of missing document(s).
* Explanation of why it cannot be obtained.
* Description of efforts made to obtain it.
* Applicant’s sworn signature and notarization (with foreign/translation logic as needed).


Orientation to the Profession – Certificate of Completion (First Department)
Handle everything through a single “Orientation / OCA” module driven by the user’s Department. For AD1, show three mutually exclusive options: (1) “I will complete Orientation” – remind them it’s required, collect viewing date(s)/codes, and require upload of the signed Orientation Certificate; (2) “I qualify for an AD1 Orientation exemption under 22 NYCRR 602.3” – collect basic info and exemption category, then generate or require upload of the § 602.3 Affidavit and remove the Orientation Certificate from their checklist; and (3) “I have a court/Committee-approved Orientation waiver/modification” – require upload of the order/letter (and any hardship affidavit) and likewise treat Orientation as satisfied with no certificate or § 602.3 affidavit. For AD2, show only the “Complete Orientation” path, require upload of the signed Orientation Certificate, and flag that file to print last in the AD2 packet; for AD3/AD4, do not show any Orientation document slot at all.
Within the same module, add an OCA registration block for all Departments: display a universal reminder that initial online attorney registration with OCA and payment of the $375 fee is required before admission, let users record the registration date, and treat the OCA receipt as a required upload only for AD2 (optional/for user records in AD1, AD3, and AD4, so it never blocks their checklist outside AD2).
Required When: Orientation to the Profession
* AD1 & AD2: Must complete the online Orientation to the Profession and file the Certificate of Completion with the admission packet (name, BOLE ID/registration no., department, viewing date(s), all codes, signature/date). AD1: must be completed before admission; AD2: can be done any time after the bar exam/motion and the certificate must be the last exhibit in the AD2 packet.
* AD3 & AD4: No separate online Orientation-to-the-Profession certificate is required in the admission packet; the SaaS does not need to track an orientation form for these Departments. 
OCA Attorney Registration
* All Departments (AD1–AD4): Before admission, applicants must complete online attorney registration with OCA and pay the $375 fee; there is no form for the app to generate, just a step to remind users about.
* AD2 only: The OCA registration receipt / certificate of payment must be attached to the admission packet; for AD1, AD3, and AD4 the receipt is not a required exhibit (you can let users upload it optionally).
Orientation Exemption – Affidavit Pursuant to 22 NYCRR § 2.3 (First Department)
Orientation Exemption – Affidavit Pursuant to 22 NYCRR § 602.3 (AD1 only)
AD1 applicants who qualify under 602.3(c) (no NY practice in first 2 years, 5+ years’ practice elsewhere, or full-time U.S. Armed Forces) may file an orientation exemption instead of a Certificate of Completion. The app should: (1) show an “I qualify for an AD1 orientation exemption” path, (2) collect basic applicant info (name, BOLE ID) and the exemption category with brief supporting facts, and (3) generate or prompt upload of the Affidavit Pursuant to § 602.3 (notarized, with translation/foreign-notary logic), then skip the orientation-certificate requirement in that user’s checklist.
Orientation Waiver / Modification Request (Undue Hardship)
For AD1 only, there is also a rare, discretionary Orientation waiver/modification for undue hardship, used when an applicant cannot reasonably complete Orientation and does not neatly qualify for a 22 NYCRR 602.3 exemption (e.g., serious illness, disability, military deployment) but the Court/Committee authorizes a waiver, extension, or alternate format; in the SaaS, this should not appear as a normal “path,” but simply let users who indicate they have a court- or Committee-approved Orientation waiver/modification upload the relevant order/letter or hardship affidavit (with any supporting documents) and, once uploaded, treat the Orientation item as satisfied without requiring a Certificate or 602.3 exemption affidavit.


Translation Documentation (Non-English Documents)
Required When: Whenever any document (forms, certificates, court records, etc.) is not in English.
Information needed for each non-English document
* Identification of the original document (e.g., “Spanish criminal record dated…”).
* Complete English translation.
* Translator’s certification including:
   * Translator’s full name, contact information, and qualifications,
   * Statement that the translation is accurate and complete.
The app should:
* Ask “Is this document in English?” on upload;
* If “no,” require an associated translation + translator certification.
These rules apply to:
* Character affirmations,
* Employment affirmations,
* Pro bono/skills affidavits,
* Law school certificates,
* Good standing / grievance letters,
* Orientation/waiver/exemption forms,
* Any supporting court, academic, or financial documents.


Certificate of Attesting Officer’s Authority (Foreign Notarizations)
When required
If any affidavit, affirmation, or the Questionnaire is sworn outside the U.S., its commonwealths, territories, or possessions before an officer who is not a notary public with a recognized seal.
Information needed
* Country/jurisdiction of execution.
* Title/office of the attesting officer.
* Separate certificate or document from appropriate authority confirming that the officer is authorized to administer oaths/affirmations or witness signatures in that jurisdiction.
* Date of such certificate.
The app should trigger this requirement whenever a user indicates they signed before a non-U.S. notary/attesting officer without a standard notary seal.


Optional Additional Supporting Letters / Explanations
Relevant when: Applicants may choose to provide more than the minimum (e.g., additional character references, explanatory letters).
Information handled:
* “Add optional character/reference letters” – upload plus short description.
* “Add an explanatory statement” – structured template referencing relevant Questionnaire question(s), with space for a narrative.

Group 13 – Signing, Notary, and Nonresident Designation
Guidance text (non-input):
Before you sign, you will need a notary (or other authorized official) to watch you sign this application and, if required, your Designation of Agent.
Best option if you work at a firm:
Most firms have one or more in-house notaries (often assistants, reception, HR, or office services).
                  * Ask your supervisor, HR contact, or office manager who the notaries are.
                  * Email or message them to set up a short in-person signing.
                  * Bring a government-issued ID and the printed application pages that need notarization.
If your firm does not have a notary or you are not working yet:
You can usually find a notary at:
                  * Banks or credit unions
                  * Shipping/office stores (for example, many UPS Store locations)
                  * Local mailboxes/print shops or “Notary Public” storefronts
Call ahead or check online to confirm hours, fees, and whether an appointment is required.

More Information about Reqs 

Big picture Reqs - had Chat scan some docs that show overall requirements so you can see/understand all components and we can add a few more components: 
Eligibility, pre-exam logistics, and the UBE: You must first be educationally eligible under Court of Appeals Rule 520 (for most people, an ABA-approved JD under 520.3). You create NCBE and BOLE accounts, have your law school send BOLE the required “Certificate of Attendance” (so you’re cleared to sit), and complete any BOLE “specimen of handwriting” form your school still handles for the bar. Then you apply to sit for the UBE in New York and pass with a score of at least 266. Both your UBE score and your complete admission application must fall within three years of the second day of that UBE under Rule 520.12(d).

NYLC, NYLE, and MPRE: Separate from the UBE, you must complete the online New York Law Course (NYLC) and pass the New York Law Exam (NYLE); each can be taken up to one year before or three years after you pass the UBE, but they expire if not used in time. You also must pass the MPRE with a scaled score of 85, and that score must still be valid (within four years) at the time BOLE certifies you to an Appellate Division.

Pro bono and skills requirements: You must complete at least 50 hours of qualifying pro bono work under Rule 520.16 and later file the official Form Affidavit of Compliance with the 50-Hour Pro Bono Requirement. You also must satisfy the Skills Competency and Professional Values requirement under Rule 520.18 through one of the approved “pathways” and obtain the official Skills Competency affidavit. The two requirements are independent: the same experience can sometimes count for both, but you still must separately certify your 50 hours and your chosen skills pathway.

Law school paperwork, BOLE certification, and the admission packet: You must graduate and have each law school you attended complete and send the official Law School Certificate for admission directly to the appropriate Appellate Division (it does not come back through you)  [so this should provide language like - 'here is your law school cert form, send this to your school email or portal that they requested, and have a spot where an email can be auto-sent or just downloadable?']. 

Once you have passed the UBE, NYLC/NYLE, and MPRE and met eligibility, the Board of Law Examiners issues a Notice of Certification assigning you to an Appellate Division based on your address; a copy of that certification must be filed with your admission application. Within three years of the second day of your qualifying UBE, you must file a complete Application for Admission with that court using the uniform forms: the Application for Admission Questionnaire, Moral Character affirmations, Law-Related Employment (or solo practice) affirmations, 50-Hour Pro Bono Affidavit, Skills Competency Affidavit, Law School Certificate(s), and the BOLE certification letter, plus any Pro Bono Scholars affidavit if relevant. If you are already admitted elsewhere, you also must supply certificates of good standing and grievance/disciplinary letters from each jurisdiction. In addition, depending on your history, you may need to submit supporting documents such as a birth certificate, name-change or divorce orders, immigration or naturalization papers, military discharge, bankruptcy records, and any police or court records for criminal/traffic matters, with notarization and certified English translations where required.

Orientation, address changes, and non-resident designation: If you are in the First or Second Department, you must complete that department’s “Orientation to the Profession” program (First Dept: online program under 22 NYCRR 602.3; Second Dept: a separate three-hour program within its required window) and obtain the Orientation certificate; the Third and Fourth Departments do not currently require such videos for standard exam-route applicants.  [so we need reminders or links to these]

Throughout, you must keep BOLE and the Appellate Division updated about address changes, and in some cases you may need to request a transfer of certification and application between Departments if your residence or primary employment moves across Department lines before admission. If, at the time you are admitted, you neither reside in New York nor are employed full-time here, you must also file the required instrument designating the Appellate Division clerk as your agent for service of process (the non-resident designation).

Character & Fitness, registration, and swearing-in: Every applicant undergoes a Character & Fitness investigation and appears for a personal interview (over zoom I think usually) with a Character & Fitness Committee member before being recommended for admission. Before the court will admit you, you must complete initial online attorney registration with the New York Unified Court System and pay the $375 biennial registration fee under Judiciary Law § 468-a and 22 NYCRR Part 118 (unless you qualify for a specific exemption). Once the Appellate Division issues an order admitting you, you must take the attorney’s oath and sign the roll (or complete whatever oath/roll procedure that Department uses); only after the oath and roll-signing are you formally a New York attorney.
